# Welcome to GaugeLink, a semi-automatic transmission simulator.

**Team:** WeAreLost

**Members:** Joseph Andaya, Nathaniel Chin, Edward Kim, Jared Weiler, Jonathan Wummer

The project was developed using Scrum development method and Unit testing using JUnit. 

**Individual Contributions:**
As a programmer in the group, I was responsible for delivering assigned user stories on time, estimates how much work each feature will take to implement, and all work-logs were updated via Axosoft.

**Team Goals:**
- As a team, we wanted to improve our skills with GUI development so that we are better 
prepared for our academic and professional career.
- To improve our skills with GUI development and use of Java Swing, we wanted to explore and familiarize ourselves 
with GUI features and libraries in Java.
- We wanted to develop an engaging product that has value to those familiar and unfamiliar 
with manual transmission.

  This program is designed to help individuals understand the basics of driving 
  a manual transimission car, or a car with a manual shifting option.  For
  simplicity of learning, a clutch is not offered in this program.

  You will operate an accelerator ('shift' key) and two other buttons to shift up ('a' key) or shift down ('z' key)
  through the gears of the transmission.  There will also be a series of gauges to inform you of how your car is running.

  If this is your first time manually shifting gears on a vehicle, here are some gear/transmission basics.

    - Lower gears provide easy, quick acceleration, but low top speed.  

    - Imagine riding a small BMX bicycle: it is very easy to pedal and get up to speed, 
     but you may only achieve 10-13 mph.

    - If you are starting from a stop sign or red light, you should use first gear,
     and shift up as you build speed
        
    - Higher gears accelerate slowly, but can achieve very high speeds.  

    - Imagine riding a large mountain bicycle or road bicycle: 
     the higher gears make it very difficult to pedal or accelerate, but you can 
     relatively easily cruise above 24 mph and keep up with cars in local streets.

    - If you are holding a constant speed and not accelerating, you should use the
     highest gear that keeps your vehicle's RPM above 1800.

    - Most cars have usable power between 1800 - 3200 RPM.  

    - When you shift up gears, your RPM will drop with the same vehicle speed.  
     Try shifting up at the top of this range to keep RPM in between this 
     range to maximize fuel economy.

    - When you shift down, your RPM will increase with the same vehicle speed.  
     Try shifting down at the bottom of this range to avoid over-revving your engine.

    - If you want to maximize performance, use the RPM range of 4000 to the rev limit 
     (9000 in this case, varies by car). However, this will burn more fuel, and revving over
     the limit can destroy your engine.
